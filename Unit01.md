**Unit 1: Introduction to STS** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to Science and Technology Studies. STS
draws from several disciplines, primarily in the humanities and social
sciences. These disciplines include anthropology, cultural studies,
history, philosophy, political science, and public policy. However, the
field is best understood in the ways in which it approaches to science
and technology. The major approaches or subfields of STS include the
philosophy of science, institutional sociology of science, sociology of
scientific knowledge (the Strong Programme, or SSK), actor-network
theory (ANT), feminist and ecofeminist studies of science, and other
critical and cultural studies of science and technology. This unit also
introduces important thinkers who have contributed significantly to
these subfields or approaches.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this video.
    While you are watching, take notes on the definitions of STS, its
    history, and its future, according to the speakers. This video is of
    a session of the conference on “Science and Technology Studies: The
    Next Twenty,” held on April 7-9, 2011, at Harvard’s Kennedy School
    of Government. After an introduction by the chair of the panel,
    three major contributors to STS speak: Trevor Pinch of Cornell
    University, David Kaiser of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
    andAntoine Picon of Harvard University. Pay close attention to the
    speakers, but do not worry about understanding the inside jokes and
    other trivial anecdotes. Take notes on the different approaches to
    STS that are discussed. Enjoy this informal and lively introduction
    to the field!  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article,
    in which Helen Longino introduces the STS field. Note the various
    approaches to science and technology discussed. This reading can be
    quite dense in parts, so do not worry about understanding every
    point. Rather, work at grasping the central ideas. One of the most
    important ideas is that these relatively new approaches to science
    do not consider science an autonomous or self-sufficient field that
    can be understood in isolation from social, political, economic,
    gender, or other factors. While they conceive of these impacts
    differently, most agree (though some philosophers are exceptions)
    that science cannot be understood strictly in terms of its own
    internal logic or reasoning.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article,
    in which some major contributors to the field, such as Roger Cooter,
    Maurice Crosland, Brian Easlea, David Gooding, Rupert Hall, and John
    Hendry, introduce the history of science. Each of these historians
    of science deals with different, although overlapping, aspects of
    the field. Pay attention to the major themes in these introductions.
    One major theme is that the history of science no longer treats the
    ideas and practices of science as autonomous or self-sufficient
    phenomena. Rather, the history of science today treats science and
    its practitioners as fully immersed in their social, economic,
    political, ideological, philosophical, personal, gendered, and other
    contexts. David Gooding provides perhaps the most up-to-date
    assessment of the field, noting that recent trends involve the study
    of actions and artifacts – what scientists have done and what
    objects they have convened with – as important factors in the making
    of science.

    Denton says in connection with ANT, introduced above.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Part 3 of
    this article, which provides an overview of feminist studies and
    critiques of science. Some parts of the reading are quite dense.
    Take note of and look up any unfamiliar words and terms. Do not
    worry if you cannot grasp everything completely, but do try to grasp
    some of the central concerns and concepts. In particular, feminist
    critics of science suggest that women are marginalized from
    scientific activity in terms of participation. Furthermore, these
    critics suggest that science’s very concepts are biased in
    masculinist ways that both reflect and suit the dominant
    participants in science and society. Some critiques are normative in
    addition to being strictly descriptive. That is, they seek not only
    to describe how science does operate but also to suggest how it
    should operate.

**1.2.9 Other Critical and Cultural Studies of Science** <span
id="1.2.9"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wesleyan University: Joseph Rouse’s “Cultural Studies of
    Science”**
    Link: Wesleyan University: Joseph Rouse’s [“Cultural Studies of
    Science”](http://works.bepress.com/jrouse/11/) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and then click
    “download” to download and read this introduction to cultural
    studies of science. The material is very dense in places, but do not
    let its difficulty deter you from moving forward. Some sentences are
    best understood after reading subsequent ones. The point here is to
    grasp the key concepts: 1) Cultural studies of science is
    anti-essentialist. That is, it does not consider science as having a
    pre-existing essence, a given set of values, or even given
    operational norms. Rather, these are established in the process of
    doing particular science initiatives themselves.  2) Cultural
    studies of science, unlike other, mostly descriptive studies such as
    SSK, is normative. Since Cultural studies of science does not
    consider science as having pre-existing norms and values, these
    values and norms are actually shaped or constructed in the process
    of doing science. The cultural studies practitioner, according to
    Rouse, can thus have a part in shaping such norms and values, and
    consequently, scientific knowledge itself.
