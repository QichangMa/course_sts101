This course will introduce you to the field known as Science and
Technology Studies (STS). STS is an interdisciplinary field that
examines how science and technology shape societies, cultures, and the
environment and how social, cultural, and environmental factors shape
the development of science and technology. These rich connections are
most easily seen in areas such as the Internet and other digital
technologies; the biological sciences (including biotechnology,
genetics, and genomics); medical sciences and technologies; energy
sciences and technologies; and ecological and environmental sciences.
STS also studies the history of science, focusing on how social and
cultural values and interests have shaped science and technology. This
course begins with an introduction to STS and continues by examining the
nature of science according to various philosophical perspectives. In
the process, you will be introduced to key terms necessary for
understanding those perspectives. When you have finished this course,
you will be able to explain developments in science and technology in
terms of their interactions with social, cultural, environmental, and
other issues. This course will also prepare you for the STS major by
introducing its core components: the philosophy of science, history of
science, history of technology, science and ethics, and science policy.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   define STS;
-   define key terms necessary for understanding the field of STS;
-   identify and define the major subfields or approaches to the field
    of STS;
-   define the nature of science and technology according to several key
    philosophical perspectives;
-   identify and define the major methodologies of each of the
    subfields;
-   identify major thinkers in the field and pair them with their
    respective approaches and/or methods;
-   compare and contrast the various STS approaches;
-   draw on case studies in order to discuss and identify how the major
    approaches or subfields may be used to explain and/or critique
    particular scientific and technological phenomena; and
-   identify and explain legitimate questions and criticisms that STS
    poses to the science and technology fields.

### Course Information

Welcome to STS101: Introduction to Science, Technology, and Society.
General information about this course and its requirements can be found
below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Michael D. Rectenwald, Ph.D. and [Dr. Warren
Dym](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrWarrenDym)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a variety of free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the following
sources:  

-   Carnegie Mellon University: Professor Michael Rectenwald’s
    *[Interpretation and Argument: Science and Technology, and
    Society](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mdr2/classes/76_101_D_Fall_04/)*
-   Robert M. Young’s *[Darwin’s Metaphor: Nature’s Place in Victorian
    Culture](http://human-nature.com/dm/dar.html)*
-   [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to pass the final exam with a score of 70% or higher.
Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it. If
you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take approximately **97 hours**
to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to use these time
advisories to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks
to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
unit 1 should take 21.25 hours. Perhaps you can look at your calendar
and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night;
subunit 1.2 (a total of 18.25 hours) on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
nights; etc.
