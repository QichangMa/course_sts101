**Unit 4: History of Science and History of Technology** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Unit 4 will introduce you to the history of science and the history of
technology, broad fields that study past science and technology
respectively. Fifty or more years ago, the history of science consisted
mostly of scientists and philosophers who treated science as if it
existed in a vacuum apart from social, cultural, economic, gender,
personal, and other considerations. Science was seen as developing
strictly on the basis of its own internal logic and momentum, often in a
teleological manner, as it moved ever more closely toward the truth.
Past science was often evaluated in terms of present or “correct”
science and seen as its precursor, or as a series of mistakes that were
finally overcome. Pseudoscience was dismissed, except to demonstrate the
difference between it and legitimate science.*  
  
 *All of that has changed. Since the publication in 1961 of Thomas
Kuhn’s path-breaking work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and
the emboldened stance of SKK, the history of science began to
incorporate methods and attitudes from history proper, examining
scientific developments in connection with social, cultural, and even
personal forces and values. Science is no longer imagined as a steady
march toward truth. Rather, it is treated as a fully context-dependent
enterprise. The boundary between legitimate science and pseudoscience,
moreover, is seen as shifting and only visible in the past. Moreover,
historians of science no longer view accepted science as an inevitable
development.*  
  
 *Around the same time as the history of science began developing its
contemporary approaches, the history of technology also became
interested in the study of social and cultural factors as they impacted
the field, while at the same time examining the impacts of technology on
society and culture. In 1958, the [Society for the History of
Technology](http://www.historyoftechnology.org/)was founded “to
encourage the study of the development of technology and its relations
with society and culture.”*  
  
 *Many historians of science and technology employ one or more STS
methodology, such as sociology of science, SSK, ANT, feminist, Cultural
Studies, or other approaches to explain the development and growth of
past scientific knowledge and technology. If you would like to know how
social and cultural factors help shape scientific and technological
developments and decisions, then you will enjoy the history of science
and the history technology. No special background in science and
technology is absolutely required, although the fields surely include
scientific and technological content. The workings of the history of
science and technology are best understood by example. In this unit, we
include discussions of the history of science and the history of
technology by several practitioners, as well as case studies from these
fields.*

-   **Reading: Robert M. Young’s Darwin’s Metaphor: Nature’s Place in
    Victorian Culture: “Introduction, Chapter 1, and Chapter 5”**
    Link: Robert M. Young’s *Darwin’s Metaphor: Nature’s Place in
    Victorian Culture:* [“Introduction, Chapter 1, and Chapter
    5”](http://human-nature.com/dm/dar.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above. Read the introduction on the
    main page, and then read chapters 1 and 5. This book is a classic in
    the history of science, one of the most important for placing Darwin
    in his social, cultural, political, and scientific contexts. This
    book is dense in parts and should be read with access to an online
    encyclopedia in order to look up the many references that it makes.
    This work is important for us not so much for the actual history
    that it traces (though this is important in itself) but for the kind
    of historiography (or method for writing history) that it
    illustrates. This is a historiography that considers science as
    fully a part of its social and historical moment.  
      
     Reading these chapters should take approximately 6 hours.

-   **Reading: The Victorian Web: Michael Rectenwald’s “Darwin’s
    Ancestors: The Evolution of Evolution”**
    Link: The Victorian Web: Michael Rectenwald’s [“Darwin’s Ancestors:
    The Evolution of
    Evolution”](http://www.victorianweb.org/science/darwin/rectenwald.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this essay,
    which serves as an example of contemporary history of science. It
    discusses evolutionary theory prior to Charles Darwin. This
    treatment of earlier, otherwise overlooked or ignored precursors
    represents a trend in recent historiography in the history of
    science. Those types of works tend to neglect figures in the history
    of science who were later superseded by “correct” scientific ideas
    and thinkers. In fact, aspects of earlier, discarded theories are
    often restored by later thinkers. This kind of historiography
    differs from an earlier, “Whiggish” history, which viewed past
    science as inevitably pointing to and resulting in present science.
    Contemporary historians of science no longer view accepted science
    as an inevitable development.

    diverges from the largely descriptive studies of how technologies
    already embed values to a normative and pragmatic mode in which
    values are purposively embedded in technology by designers.
