**Unit 6: Other Critical and Cultural Studies of Science** <span
id="6"></span> 
*A great deal of scholarship that engages science and technology does
not fit comfortably within the categories outlined in previous units.
This includes research that examines ideology in science and technology,
work that examines cultural aspects of knowledge, studies that employ
critical theory to examine scientific knowledge and technological
developments, research that treats the relationship between literature
and science and technology, postmodernist accounts of science, and even
work that relies on an examination of science fiction and sci-fi film to
make commentaries and critiques of science and technology. Much of the
research in this category or subfield is intentionally normative in
outlook. That is, it aims at criticizing science to effect change. It
cuts across disciplinary boundaries and includes varied epistemological
convictions.*  
  
 *This unit aims to introduce such scholarship and to examine a
selection of such works through case studies. In no way is this survey
of material meant to be exhaustive, as this is a very broad and
heterogeneous approach or subfield within STS.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10.25 hours.

Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   identify issues important to critical and cultural studies of
    science and technology scholars;

    technology;
-   compare and contrast contemporary approaches to one another and to
    other approaches within STS;

    Read this article. This reading can be dense in places. The most
    important issues to grasp have to do with the difference between
    cultural studies of science on one hand and other sociological and
    philosophical traditions on the other. First, the cultural studies
    of science does not respect the boundaries between the “inside” and
    “outside” of science. Second, it is neither relativistic like
    constructivist studies, nor does it aim to impose a single
    epistemological imperative from the “outside” of science, like the
    socialist scientist and historian of science, J.D. Bernal. The broad
    features of this heterogeneous field include: 1) its
    anti-essentialism, 2) a non-explanatory engagement with science, 3)
    emphasis on the materiality of scientific practice, 4) emphasis on
    the cultural open-ness of scientific practice, 5) the subversion of
    (rather than opposition to) scientific realism and the supposed
    value-neutrality of science, and 6) a commitment to the epistemic
    and political criticism of science from within the culture of
    science. These features are discussed at greater length in the
    essay.
