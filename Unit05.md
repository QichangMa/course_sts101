**Unit 5: Feminist and Ecofeminist Studies and Critiques of Science**
<span id="5"></span> 
*Unit 5 will introduce feminist and ecofeminist studies and critiques of
science. Feminists have engaged with science at least since the early
1970s, with the beginning of Third Wave feminism. Feminists are
concerned with such issues as the disproportionate representation of men
versus women in science, inequity in the treatment of women in science,
the representation of gender in science, a gender-biased approach to
research, and a masculine conceptual bias at the heart of the scientific
enterprise, among other issues. Ecofeminists see continuity between the
way science and technology treat women and the way they treat nature.*  
  
 *Most feminist and ecofeminist studies of science and technology are
normative or prescriptive in their approach. That is, while in many
cases they may aim at describing how science and technology actually
operate, the overall objective is usually one of critique in order to
show how science should work. Feminist and ecofeminist studies of
science cut across disciplinary boundaries and epistemological outlooks.
In this unit, you will learn about the way feminists have engaged with
science and the major issues that they consider. You will examine the
major threads of feminist and ecofeminist engagements with science, as
well as case studies in feminist and ecofeminist scholarship.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article,
    which introduces the issues of feminist epistemology – how knowledge
    can be affected by the gender of the knower. In particular it
    examines how, according to some feminist scholars, gender can and
    does impact the knowledge that science produces. The reading is
    dense in parts and is fairly long. Further, some of it overlaps with
    the previous reading. The central concepts have to do with the
    critique of standard empiricism of science as a value-laden
    enterprise and the kinds of interventions that feminism can have
    within the contexts and content of science.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 5 hours.
