**Unit 2: The Philosophy of Science and the Nature of Science** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit introduces the philosophy of science and then examines a set
of “academic” questions about the nature of science. Drawing on various
perspectives from the philosophy of science, this unit will address such
questions as: What counts as knowledge? How is knowledge derived? What
is science? What does it mean to practice science? While we cannot be
exhaustive in our survey of the answers, this unit will be able to
provide some characteristic responses from the major philosophical
perspectives on epistemology. By epistemology, we mean theories about
how knowledge is to be defined and in particular what counts as
scientific knowledge.*  
  
 *As we will soon see, the answers are not as simple as we might expect,
and definitions are the source of significant controversies in the STS
field. The controversies about the nature of science (and sometimes of
technology) help to frame the major questions addressed by the field of
STS more broadly. While epistemological questions are primarily the
concern of philosophers of science, as we shall see, such questions are
relevant for the other approaches/subfields as well. Most of the
theorists and practitioners in STS hold some kind of pragmatism,
conventionalism, or constructivism, or a combination thereof. Few, if
any, are empiricists or logical empiricists.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article
    on empiricism, up to “The Intuition/Deduction Thesis.” Empiricism is
    the theory that scientific knowledge is derived from sense data,
    including observation and experimentation. This reading discusses
    empiricism at greater length.

**2.2.2 Logical Positivism and Logical Empiricism** <span

    Positivism”**

    Positivism”](http://www.loyno.edu/~folse/logpos.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    Logical positivism (sometimes called “logical empiricism”) is the
    theory that scientific knowledge consists of statements that
    correspond to objective reality and that can be verified through
    observation and testing. This reading discusses the movement of
    logical positivism more fully, including its main tenets and
    subsequent history. Some parts of this reading are dense. Do not
    worry if you do not grasp every point. The main concept to grasp is
    that science consists of statements or questions that can be
    verified through observation and that statements or questions that
    cannot be tested do not belong in the realm of science, nor do the
    answers to such questions. For example, the question “Is there a
    God?” does not belong in the realm of science because it is not
    testable, and further, we do not know the conditions that would need
    to be met in order to answer the question in the affirmative. This
    division of statements into scientific and metaphysical or
    theoretical types is known as the demarcation problem (treated
    above).

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    Pragmatism is the theory that scientific knowledge is derived from
    experience and practice, including experimentation, and that truth
    is determined by practical results, such as prediction and control
    of the object world.

**2.2.4 Conventionalism** <span id="2.2.4"></span>

    Paul Hoyningen-Huene’s “The Incommensurability of Scientific
    Theories”**
    Link: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Eric Oberheim and Paul
    Hoyningen-Huene’s [“The Incommensurability of Scientific
    Theories”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    Conventionalism is the theory that scientific knowledge is based
    neither on experimental inference (conclusions derived from
    experience and/or experimentation) nor on *a priori* (pre-existing)
    belief but rather on changing conventions within a field. This
    reading treats conventionalism in greater depth. Pay particular
    attention to Thomas Kuhn’s notion of the paradigm.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 5 hours.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read part 3,
    “Anti-Classical Approaches.” Constructivism is the theory that
    scientific knowledge consists not of discovered facts and theories
    but of constructs that scientists place on the world. This reading
    provides a brief but helpful overview of the positions of
    constructivism and the differences between various positions within
    it. Pay particular attention to the distinctions between “weak” and
    “strong” constructivism, as well as between descriptive and
    normative constructivism.
