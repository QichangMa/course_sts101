title: "STS101: Introduction to Science, Technology, and Society"
course_description: "This course explains developments in science and technology in terms of their interactions with social, cultural, environmental, and other issues. This course will prepare you for the STS major by introducing its core components: the philosophy of science, history of science, history of technology, science and ethics, and science policy."

**Unit 3: Three STS Approaches from the Social Sciences** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit introduces you to three significant subfields of STS, two
from the discipline of sociology and one from sociology and
anthropology: institutional sociology of science; the sociology of
scientific knowledge (SSK), or the Strong Programme; and actor-network
theory (ANT).*  
  
 *These STS approaches aim to explain the connection between social
factors and science and technology. As you will see, social studies of
science and technology have a tendency to demystify the prestigious
fields of science and technology, treating them as they do other common
social phenomena, such as the family or broader kinship unit. Since
scientists often claim special status and science has historically
presented itself as exempt from social influence, the social studies of
science and technology have been a source of significant controversy. In
their more radical forms, they have instigated what some have referred
to as the “Science Wars” – strenuous debates between pro-science
advocates and critics of science and technology.*  
  
 *The three social science approaches treated here are descriptive
rather than prescriptive or normative. That is, they aim to describe
science and technology as they actually function, rather than how they
should function.*

**3.2 The Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK), or the Strong
Programme** <span id="3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Carnegie Mellon University: David Bloor’s Knowledge and
    Social Imagery: “The Strong Programme in the Sociology of
    Knowledge”**
    Link: Carnegie Mellon University: David Bloor’s *Knowledge and
    Social Imagery*: [“The Strong Programme in the Sociology of
    Knowledge”](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/76-101AA/readings/Bloor.htm)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this chapter
    from David Bloor’s *Knowledge and Social Imagery*. The reading may
    seem dense in parts, but do not worry if you do not understand every
    point. The major points to understand include the four principles of
    SSK: 1) causality, 2) impartiality, 3) symmetry, and 4) reflexivity.
    The section on the objections to the Strong Programme may be more
    difficult to comprehend. The main point to grasp is that SSK
    considers science explicable in terms of the principles of SSK and
    that claims to the contrary are unscientific, according to Bloor.

**3.3 Actor-Network Theory (ANT)** <span id="3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Bruno Latour’s “Networks, Societies, Spheres: Reflections
    of an Actor-network Theorist”**
    Link: Bruno Latour’s [“Networks, Societies, Spheres: Reflections of
    an Actor-network Theorist”](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/article)

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and click on the link
    to article 121 to download the PDF. Read this article, which
    provides some depth and context for the articles on ANT that you
    read in unit 1.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 2 hours.

-   **Reading: Corpus Christi College: Farzana Dudhwala’s “What is
    Actor-Network Theory?”**

    Actor-Network
    Theory?”](http://cambridge.academia.edu/FarzanaDudhwala/Papers/540867/What_is_Actor-Network_Theory)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this article, which
    does a very good job in distinguishing the ANT approach with what is
    called “classical sociology” here. Classical sociology, of which SSK
    is a part, takes the “social” as a given, *a priori* entity or set
    of forces that are assumed to pre-exist and impact the various
    characters in society. ANT suggests that the social cannot be
    assumed to exist in advance of investigation. The social is
    something that results from the activity of actors. It is a product
    rather than a cause of activity. This has important implications for
    the study of science and technology because it suggests that one
    cannot posit social forces as having an impact on science and
    technology. Rather, the social is an effect of scientific and
    technological activity.
